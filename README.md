# Intelligent-Detection-of-TV-Viewer-Engagement-using-Body-Language
This system aims to analyse the varying levels of engagement a viewer maintains while watching any kind of television content, including movies, shows, or documentaries. Analyses are linked to television content using show codes and these are used to generate content specific reports. These reports can be sent on to television content providers to provide a more detailed representation of what viewers are actually interested in. This is in contrast to current analysis models which simply use viewer counts to conclude whether content is being watched or not. Such traditional methods can be inaccurate due to a multitude of reasons. For example, viewer counts do not explicitly state viewer engagement, as hundreds of people leave their entertainment sets on during the lengthy durations of the day while not necessarily being engaged at all times. Furthermore, some content providers, such as Netflix, consider their content as completely watched even if the viewer watches only two minutes of the content in question. This is regardless if the viewer decided to switch content soon after and, as a result, leads to flawed and inaccurate analysis of viewer engagement. This project uses Computer Vision and Deep Learning to derive levels of viewer engagement through their body language and analyses such results to help TV network providers assess their performance.
